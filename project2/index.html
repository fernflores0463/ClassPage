			Have you ever sat at a hackey game watching our Tigers kick some ass, but sometimes feel like there 
		is something missing? Well, you are you are missing the one and only Tiger sauce that is made by Tigers, for 
		Tigers. Tiger Sauce has a little bit of everything. It gives you the best of both worlds, spicy, but also sweet.
		**Note: Tiger Sauce is not included in the cost of tuition
