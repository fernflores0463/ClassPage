		<p> I think I have done well with the website when it comes to it's colors and pictures. I think that the colors are very cool
			and are consistent throughout the site and there is not too much contrast. It is also aesthetically pleasing to see this website on both the web and mobile.
			I also like the work I have done with the navigation bar. It works smoothly on both a browser and mobile. This is very important today because more and more web traffic is being being handled through mobile devices than ever before and having an easy to navigate site is the key to success in the industry. I also think I chose a good theme for the site mostly because i love the TigerSauce that is at the Ritz SportZone.
		</p>
		<p> However I think that there is much room for improvement in this website. As you may have noticed there is no Javascript on this page, and I wished there were because
			the site would be much more dynamic, interactive, and interesting. Improvements cn also be made in the responsiveness of the design overall. I don't like the way it looks at certain sizes, but the the 480px version looks very nice. The iPad size one, not that much. Another are that needs improvement is the content. There is no official brand of RIT Tigersauce so it was pretty hard to actually come up with prices and other stuff to make the page more realistic. If RIT actually sold the sauce I could have put together much more information other than price.</p>
